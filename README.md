# eSciences_code_demo
API-gymnastics
## This Demo demonstrates several tasks common in exploring new projects, algorithms and technologies
- Using an API and code to fetch, filter, convert, reshape and summarize data in real time
- Using new technology as a compute cluster securely over a network (in this case a DIY single Board Computer Cluster)
- Cluster job submission using Dask Distributed (among the many others)
- Exploratory data analysis of relevance to practical questions in a domain
- Dynamic and static figures for analyses
- Pandas dataframes
- Time Series analysis with Prophet
- An API for heterogeneous services with sloppy and diverse returns (CCXT)

  ## What this Demo is not designed to demo
  - An interactive software product served for users on the web (notebook or lab use only)
  - A Full Stack or Cloud serverless or container implementation
